    <li><strong>Improvement and Marketing:</strong> With your consent, we use non-identifying data to improve our services, assess site traffic, and offer promotions aligned with your preferences. We ensure that any data collected is transparent, and we fully comply with Google’s guidelines by not misrepresenting any element of our services or the fees associated with them.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Service Providers</h2>
